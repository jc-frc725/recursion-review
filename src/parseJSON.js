// this is what you would do if you were one to do things the easy way:
// var parseJSON = JSON.parse;

// but you're not, so you'll write it from scratch:
var parseJSON = function(json) {
  // your code goes here
  var result;
  console.log(json);
  
  // need function that advances one character in json string at a time

  // need functions that handle each piece of json grammar?
  // obj, member, pair, array, elements, values: string, number, bool, null
};
